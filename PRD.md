# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

This is your Ralph plan file. Replace this with your actual requirements.

You can:
- Write a PRD manually as a markdown checklist, or
- Use Cursor's plan mode (e.g. in the IDE) to generate a plan, then save it here.

The agent reads this file and `progress.txt` on each run, picks the next incomplete task, implements it, commits, and updates progress.

## Example structure

- [ ] Task 1: Add feature X
- [ ] Task 2: Add tests for X
- [ ] Task 3: Update documentation

Format can be markdown checklists, JSON, or plain prose—as long as the agent can identify individual tasks and mark them done in `progress.txt`.
